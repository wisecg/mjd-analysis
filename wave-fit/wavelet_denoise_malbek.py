"""
output is a list of vectors (cA and cD, approximation
and detail coefficients) exactly as you would expect
from swt decomposition.

	e.g. [(cA1, cD1), (cA2, cD2), ..., (cAn, cDn)]

If input is none, this function will calculate the
tresholds automatically for each waveform.
Otherwise it will use the tresholds passed in, assuming
that the length of the input is the same as the length
of the output list.

input looks like:

	[threshold1, threshold2, ..., thresholdn]

scaler is a tuning parameter that will be multiplied on
all thresholds.  Default = 1 (0.8?)
